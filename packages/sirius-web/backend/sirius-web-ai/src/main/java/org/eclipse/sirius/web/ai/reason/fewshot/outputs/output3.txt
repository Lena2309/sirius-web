To represent a smart restaurant that handles online orders and serves customers efficiently using the provided domain concepts, we can create the following structure:

1. **Create** a Restaurant named "GourmetExpress".
    - **Create** a Kitchen instance as a child of "GourmetExpress", named "MainKitchen".
    - **Create** a DiningArea instance as a child of "GourmetExpress", named "CustomerSeating".
    - **Create** an OnlineOrderSystem instance as a child of "GourmetExpress", named "OrderManager".

2. **Create** an OnlineOrderSystem instance named "WebsiteOrders".

3. Create the following links:

    - from "OrderManager" to "MainKitchen"
    - from "MainKitchen" to "CustomerSeating"

This representation ensures that the restaurant efficiently processes online orders, prepares food in the kitchen, and serves it in the dining area. Each object should have relevant property values to represent a fully functional smart restaurant.
