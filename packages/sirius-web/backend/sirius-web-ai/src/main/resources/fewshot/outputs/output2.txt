To represent an International Space Station with functional modules and communication capabilities using the provided domain concepts, we can create the following structure:

1. **Create** a SpaceStation named "ISS".
    - Create two Module instances as children of "ISS", named "LivingQuarters" and "ScienceLab".
    - Create a SolarPanel instance as a child of "ISS", named "MainSolarArray".
    - Create a CommunicationAntenna instance as a child of "ISS", named "StationAntenna".

2. **Create** a CommunicationAntenna instance named "GroundStation".

3. Create the following links:
    - from "GroundStation" to "LivingQuarters"
    - from "GroundStation" to "ScienceLab"
    - from "LivingQuarters" to "ScienceLab"

This representation ensures that the International Space Station has essential modules, power through solar panels, and a communication link with Earth.
Each object should have relevant property values to represent a functional space station.
